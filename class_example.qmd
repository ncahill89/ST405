We are interested in the proportion of people that approve of the Irish governmentâ€™s response to the housing crisis. Suppose you surveyed a sample of $n = 50$ people and $y = 20$ responded saying they approve. You wish to assume a Binomial likelihood for these data such that:

$$
y \sim \text{Binomial}(n, \theta)
$$

$$
p(y \mid \theta) = c \, \theta^y (1 - \theta)^{n-y}, \quad \text{with } c = \binom{n}{y}
$$

Now suppose a previous studyfound that the approval proportion was 

$$0.5 \pm 0.1$$ 

and you wish to define a Beta prior that incorporates this prior information such that:

$$
\theta \mid a, b \sim \text{Beta}(a, b)
$$

$$
p(\theta \mid a, b) = k \, \theta^{a-1} (1 - \theta)^{b-1}, \quad \text{with } k = \frac{1}{B(a, b)}
$$

Recall that if 

$$\theta \sim \text{Beta}(a, b)$$ 

then:

$$
\mathbb{E}(\theta) = \frac{a}{a+b}, \qquad
\text{Var}(\theta) = \frac{ab}{(a+b)^2 (a+b+1)}
$$

## Exercises

1. What values would you assign to $a$ and $b$?  

2. Write down the posterior distribution for $\theta$.  

3. What is the expected value of $\theta$ based on the posterior distribution?

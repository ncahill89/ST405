## **Introduction**

This tutorial explores Bayesian inference using JAGS.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### **Question: Bayesian Model for Multiple Proportions - Email Campaign Click-Through Rates**

A company is running three different email campaigns (A, B, and C) to promote a new product. The marketing team wants to estimate the click-through rates (CTR) for each campaign using a Bayesian approach and compare the effectiveness of the campaigns.

The data collected from these campaigns is as follows:

| Campaign | Emails Sent | Emails Clicked |
|----------|-------------|----------------|
| A        | 100         | 15             |
| B        | 120         | 20             |
| C        | 110         | 12             |

Using this data carry out the following analysis:

1.  **Model Specification**:

    -   **(a)** Specify an appropriate likelihood.

    -   **(b)** Specify a prior distribution for the CTR of each campaign, assuming you have no strong prior knowledge about success rates.

2.  **JAGS Model**:

    -   **(a)** Specify the JAGS model.

    -   **(b)** Implement the Bayesian model in JAGS using the data from the table. Run the MCMC sampling using 4,000 iterations and discarding the first 2,000 as burn-in.

    -   **(c)** Check for convergence.

3.  **Interpretation of Results**:

    -   **(a)** Plot the posterior distributions of the CTRs for the three campaigns.

    -   **(b)** Compare the posterior distributions and interpret what the results tell you about the relative effectiveness of the three email campaigns.

4.  **Additional Analysis**:

    -   **(a)** Calculate the posterior probability that Campaign B has a higher CTR than Campaign A and Campaign C, and interpret this probability.

<!-- ### **Additional Question - Markov Chain** -->

<!-- Consider the behavior of a twitter user (per hour).  Assume there are 3 possible states: the user doesn’t visit the site, the user visits but doesn't engage (tweet, retweet, like etc) and the user visits and engages.  -->

<!-- Imagine that the following probabilities have been observed: -->

<!--   - when the user doesn’t visit the site within an hour, they have a 25% chance of still not visiting the next hour, a 50% chance of visiting but not engaging and a 25% chance of visiting and engaging. -->

<!--   - when the user visits this site but doesn't engage within an hour, they have a 40% chance of visiting in the next hour and engaging, a 40% of not visiting in the next hour and a 20% chance of visiting in the next hour but not engaging. -->

<!--   - when the user visits and engages within an hour, they have a 60% chance of visiting in the next hour and engaging, a 25% chance of visiting and not engaging and a 15% chance of not visiting.  -->

<!-- Generate a markov chain using a multinomial distribution to simulate the states. You can simulate from a multinomial distribution in R using the function `rmultinom()`. Find the stationary distribution of the markov chain. What is the overall probability that a twitter user visits the site and engages?  -->

<!-- __Notes on the Multinomial distribution__ -->

<!-- The multinomial distribution arises from an extension of the binomial to situations where each trial has $k \geq 2$  possible outcomes. Suppose that we have an experiment with n independent trials, where each trial produces exactly one of the events $E_1$, $E_2, \ldots, E_k$ and on each trial each event occurs with probability $\pi_1$, $\pi_2, \ldots, \pi_k$. For example, when you have 3 events $E1, E_2$ and $E_3$ that are equally likely then you can simulate a single outcome using `rmultinom(n=1, size = 1, prob = c(1/3,1/3,1/3))` -->

<!-- __Hint:__ -->

<!-- I suggest modifying the code from the weather example used in Week 4 to answer the question.  -->
